/**
 * TASK-549 — **the owner's approved words, pinned BY VALUE.**
 *
 * On 2026-09-28 he answered *"ผ่านหมด"* to every draft in `COPY-REVIEW-2026-09-28.md` §A–§D, so **those letters are now the
 * spec** and this file is the reference: each row below is the sentence in his file, character for character, in both
 * languages.
 *
 * 🔑 **This does NOT replace the shape pins, and that is the point.** A value pin says *these letters*; a shape pin says
 * *this promise* — and **the promise is what caught all four defects.** The shape pins stay where they are
 * (`leave-claim.test.ts`, `undo-preview.test.ts`, `line-admins.test.ts`, `undo-control.test.ts`): they assert the absence
 * of a quota claim, the *"would"* framing, `ไม่ใช่การลบ` only as a denial, a title ending in `?`. ⇒ **if he rewords a
 * sentence, one line here changes and the promise is still held.** If a reword broke a promise, a shape pin fails and that
 * is a conversation, not a copy edit.
 *
 * 📌 **TASK-555 — the eight the §D table left out are now approved too** (§D2, on 09-28), so the LINE-admin page is final in
 * full: **17 of 17.** ✅ **The boundary they were held behind is kept, not deleted** (`UNREVIEWED`, below): the pin now says
 * *every key on that page is either approved or a declared draft*, so **a string that arrives tomorrow cannot pass as his.**
 * 🔑 *The mechanism is the valuable part, not the eight rows.*
 *
 * ⚠️ **Still NOT here:** the discount error strings and the attendee-note hint (marked DRAFT for their own reasons, and
 * pinned as still-marked), and §E's LINE messages, which are the backend's (TASK-550).
